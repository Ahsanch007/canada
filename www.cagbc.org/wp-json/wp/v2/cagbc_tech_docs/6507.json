There are many reasons for this. For example, the incomplete space could be for future retail on the first floor of an office tower; or for a tenant-run cafeteria in a healthcare project; or, for a university holding a floor deliberately vacant for their future needs. Alternatively, the whole interior fit-up may be incomplete under LEED BD+C: Core and Shell (CS).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>LEED v4\/v4.1 Building Design + Construction (BD+C) was written as a whole building rating system where the building is complete (e.g., fit up installed). To address incomplete space within the review process, further direction is provided in the LEED v4 BD+C Reference Guide (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.usgbc.org\/guide\/bdc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Getting Started introduction<\/a>&nbsp;and within credit explanations), LEED Interpretations, and USGBC FAQs.

LEED v4 BD+C: Core &amp; Shell:<\/strong> Only the portions of the project within the LEED scope of work are included in credit calculations and credits can generally be earned without additional measures from future tenant spaces. If a project team wishes to apply for credits that are beyond the scope of design and construction of the LEED project, a tenant sales and lease agreement, signed by future tenants, must be provided. (For example, under EA credit Enhanced Refrigerant Management, the rating system variations note if the project does not include all HVAC associated with anticipated work by the tenant but would like to use those systems to achieve the credit, documentation must be supported the lease agreement.) The lease agreement must be binding and include terms on how credit requirements will be met by the tenant. An unsigned or sample lease agreement is not acceptable.
