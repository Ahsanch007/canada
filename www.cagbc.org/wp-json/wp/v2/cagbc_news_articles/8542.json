It marks the second year of CAGBC\u2019s Green Building Day on the Hill initiative, which brings together our members with key policymakers and Parliamentarians.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGreen Building Day on the Hill is the result of ongoing work by our&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/newsmanager.commpartners.com\/linktrack.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cagbc.org%2Four-work%2Fadvocacy%2F\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Advocacy and Government Affairs team<\/a>&nbsp;to grow awareness of green buildings as a proven solution for emissions reductions, job creation and resiliency,\u201d said Thomas Mueller, CAGBC President and CEO. \u201cWe recognize that to increase market uptake at scale and achieve climate targets, green building needs the support of the industry and the federal government. This event brought together representatives from all parties to help advance green building policies and investments.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the week of Green Building Day on the Hill, CAGBC hosts meetings with influential Members of Parliament to discuss how the green building sector can help support relevant policies and programs. This year, conversations were dominated by the need for affordable and green housing as well as greater resiliency and carbon reductions in Canada\u2019s building stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>October 25 was the linchpin of Green Building Day on the Hill activities. CAGBC was joined by leaders from the green building sector and government policymakers for two panel discussions, sponsored by&nbsp;<strong>Julie Dabrusin<\/strong>, Member of Parliament for Toronto\u2013Danforth and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources and to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first panel focused on federal leadership on green building and net-zero opportunities. Much has been done to advance green building within the federal government. With over 34,000 buildings in its portfolio, the federal government has the power to fundamentally shift the market.
