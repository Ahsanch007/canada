The Challenge launched with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.concertproperties.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Concert Properties Ltd.<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.collierscanada.com\/en-CA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Colliers<\/a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.minto.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Minto Group<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.quadreal.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">QuadReal Property Group<\/a>,&nbsp;and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.triovest.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Triovest<\/a>,&nbsp;and has since expanded to include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brookfieldproperties.com\/en.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Brookfield Properties<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/ottawa.ca\/en\">the City of Ottawa<\/a>, Golden Properties, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hudsonpacificproperties.com\/\">Hudson Pacific Properties<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kingsettcapital.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">KingSett Capital<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lasalle.com\/\">LaSalle Investment Management<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/shapeproperties.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SHAPE Properties<\/a>. Together, these organizations have disclosed data from over 900 buildings \u2013 accounting for 17 million m<sup>2<\/sup> of floor space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Access to reliable data can raise awareness of carbon reductions, measure retrofit outcomes, and help inform policies and programs supporting the decarbonization of Canada\u2019s buildings \u2013 including the federal government\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rncanengagenrcan.ca\/en\/collections\/canada-green-buildings-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Green Buildings Strategy<\/a>. The idea is not new \u2013 the 2018 House of Commons and Senate reports recommended that benchmarking and data disclosure activities be regulated nationally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom already have mandatory laws designed to collect building data, for example, Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.legislation.gov.au\/Details\/C2010A00067\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act 2010<\/a>. While how they collect data and label buildings differ, the programs bring to light the data needed to enact meaningful improvements in their buildings&#8217; energy efficiency and carbon footprint.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-report-findings\">Report findings<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With three years of data, including during 2020 when the COVID-19 global pandemic directly impacted building occupancy, the Challenge enabled real estate owners to identify trends and insights related to energy use in office and multi-residential buildings and documented improved energy carbon intensity values for buildings in Alberta. In addition, the Challenge demonstrated that a disclosure and data-sharing approach for public or private real-estate managers is possible in any jurisdiction in Canada.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet barriers still exist, especially for specific building types. For example, industrial, warehouse and retail buildings found it more challenging to access complete performance data. This could be due to tenants that paid their utility bills, campus-style energy distribution where one energy meter feeds multiple buildings or a lack of direct data connections between the utility providers and data management systems. Finding a solution that provides better whole-building data collection for all building types will be essential to ensure the benefits of data collection and monitoring are fully realized.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where we go<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Increasing data transparency will help the building sector identify buildings needing zero-carbon retrofits and enable more informed choices about where to invest retrofit dollars. Backed by data, the resulting boom in deep carbon retrofit activity will foster sector innovation, create jobs, and leave future generations with better buildings for both people and the planet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data access will also make it easier for commercial real estate companies to measure themselves against their net-zero carbon targets and stated environmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives. However, this requires standardized building data that is reliable and easy to access, including (but not limited) to water and energy consumption, waste, and GHG emissions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Policy-makers also have a role to play. Access to building data can inform their efforts to develop programs that support practical carbon-reduction actions. CAGBC has called on the government to support the implementation of standardized energy benchmarking, disclosure and rating systems in provinces and territories or to provide a national one they could join. This strategy can be accomplished quickly with tools such as <a href=\"https:\/\/arcskoru.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Arc Skoru<\/a>, a globally recognized building performance platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To date, only Ontario requires public reporting of building energy data. Still, the City of Edmonton, the City of Winnipeg, the City of Montreal, the City of Ottawa, and the Province of Nova Scotia have developed voluntary approaches to whole-building data and have been actively working on benchmarking programs or plans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-main\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/20221025_cagbc_full-disclosure_report_en_final\/\">Read the report<\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-main\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/our-work\/initiatives\/disclosure-challenge\/\">Learn More<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-quote-carousel wp-block-quote-carousel--large spacing-top-3 slickjs\"><div class=\"slickjs__track\"><div class=\"slickjs__slide\"><blockquote class=\"spacing-top-0 spacing-bottom-0\"><div class=\"has-h-5-font-size has-medium-grey-color\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><p class=\"xmsonormal\">The commitment of the participants in the Disclosure Challenge over the past three years illustrates so clearly the importance of building-level data to making informed portfolio-wide decisions.
