Seven ideas rose to the top:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Operational Carbon<\/strong> \u2013 Addressing climate change and reducing carbon pollution are critical imperatives for buildings, and our members would like to see LEED improve how these are addressed. While version 4.1 addresses operational carbon explicitly, it gives it the same weight as energy reduction. Members felt the tiers of LEED should more closely connect to operational carbon reduction, and perhaps LEED Platinum should represent net zero in the next version of LEED.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Embodied Carbon<\/strong> &#8211; There was recognition that to address climate change means addressing embodied carbon and it was hoped that LEED could both strengthen how this is done and, at the same time, find easier paths (for example, prescriptive measures) to onboard all project types.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Resiliency<\/strong> \u2013 It was recognized that the market is not yet embracing resiliency but needs to. Climate risk planning should be considered in all projects.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Holistic<\/strong> \u2013 LEED must remain holistic; this is its strength.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Retrofits <\/strong>\u2013 LEED addresses major renovations in BD+C and ongoing performance in O+M; however, a rating system or guidance for retrofits might be helpful for the market.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Accessibility<\/strong> \u2013 Members came up with a number of solutions to make LEED more accessible, noting rigour does not need to equal complexity. Ideas included simplification of credits with lower point weighting; limiting external references to critical issues; inclusion of prescriptive path options; and sample submittals for each credit.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Process Improvements<\/strong> \u2013 Members also raised ideas on how to improve the process of LEED, including some suggestions for LEED Online.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The session with CAGBC members and a previous one with CAGBC technical committee members were part of a series of conversations that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usgbc.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">USGBC<\/a> is having with green builders around the world. In June of this year, USGBC released what they had heard so far with some guiding principles for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usgbc.org\/articles\/usgbc-shares-new-future-leed-principles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Future of LEED<\/a>. They noted these conversations are ongoing, and it will take our collective knowledge, passion, and commitment to achieve these goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We thank all members and volunteers that participated and look forward to continuing to work on the evolution of LEED.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Stronger emphasis on climate change was at the forefront in the discussions from&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":""},"cagbc_tx_theme":[418,420],"cagbc_tx_rating_standard":[430],"cagbc_tx_credit_category":[],"acf":{"sub-headline":"","byline":"CAGBC Staff","downloads":false,"related_links":false,"alt_thumb":false,"rating_systemstandard":[{"term_id":430,"name":"LEED","slug":"leed","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":430,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_rating_standard","description":"","parent":0,"count":111,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"theme":[{"term_id":418,"name":"Green Building","slug":"green-building","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":418,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_theme","description":"","parent":0,"count":85,"filter":"raw","meta":[]},{"term_id":420,"name":"Membership","slug":"membership","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":420,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_theme","description":"","parent":0,"count":19,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"credit_category":false},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.9 (Yoast SEO v21.9) -
