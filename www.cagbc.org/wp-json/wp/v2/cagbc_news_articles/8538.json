Yet, having just returned from the <a href=\"https:\/\/unfccc.int\/cop28\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">U.N. Climate Change Conference<\/a> (COP28) in Dubai, I am looking to 2024 with a measure of anticipation and hope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buildings were elevated at COP28 through the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unep.org\/news-and-stories\/press-release\/buildings-breakthrough-global-push-near-zero-emission-and-resilient\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Buildings Breakthrough Initiative<\/a> as playing a critical role in advancing carbon reduction and improving the lives of people all over the world. The Buildings Breakthrough Initiative is intended to increase the speed and scale of decarbonizing buildings. As part of the Initiative, Canada is showing global leadership in decarbonizing cement and concrete.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CAGBC continues to focus on accelerating green building by empowering the market with the products and training needed to achieve sustainability goals. Working with industry and government, we are developing the solutions the market needs to advance decarbonization and resiliency.&nbsp;Our targets are consistent with the global goals on zero operational carbon and a 40 percent reduction in embodied carbon by 2030.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am proud of what we accomplished this year and excited about 2024 as climate action, resiliency and adaptation imperatives take hold in Canada\u2019s building sector. We still have a long way to go but progress is being made like never before to decarbonize buildings across the globe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy Holidays!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"
