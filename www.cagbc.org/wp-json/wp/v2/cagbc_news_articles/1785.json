Our members and stakeholders in the green building industry are prepared to deliver the low-carbon, energy efficient retrofits that will help Canada reach its climate targets, create jobs and build healthier, more resilient communities. As the Prime Minister said, this is a win-win for all Canadians.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the spring, CaGBC, along with partners, members and allies, has been pushing the benefits of a green recovery. Soon to be released research shows that an investment in green building and progressive policies can achieve 1.5 million green building jobs by 2030. \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/portal.cagbc.org\/cagbcdocs\/advocacy\/CaGBC_Green_Recovery_Strategy_EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ready, Set, Grow<\/a>,\u201d CaGBC\u2019s recommendations to the government proposed investments in workforce development, zero carbon construction, and in the retrofit economy as a way to reignite the economy post pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also encouraged the use of the Canada Infrastructure Bank to kick-start retrofits by stimulating the development of shovel-ready projects, as well as de-risking investment in retrofit projects through approaches that increase confidence, like through the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.gbcicanada.ca\/icp.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Investor Confidence Project<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With today\u2019s announcement, the government is taking a significant step toward Canada\u2019s low-carbon future. The CIB\u2019s Growth Plan is expected to create approximately 60,000 jobs across the country, including in the clean energy and renewable generation and storage sector, as well as in the construction industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that infrastructure and construction are the economic engines the country turns to in moments where the economy slows. The recovery from this pandemic will be no different. Under the guidance of Sabia, the CIB is positioned not only to invest heavily, but to be a driving force to unlock private investment for energy retrofits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CIB investment as the potential to demonstrate how a pivot toward a resilient, low-carbon future can deliver an innovation-driven, job-rich and vibrant economy for all Canadians.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-main\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https:\/\/portal.cagbc.org\/cagbcdocs\/advocacy\/CaGBC_Green_Recovery_Strategy_EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Read CaGBC\u2019s green recovery recommendations<\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-main\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https:\/\/portal.cagbc.org\/cagbcdocs\/advocacy\/CaGBC_Response_to_the_Throne_Speech_EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Read CaGBC\u2019s response to the Throne Speech<\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-main\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Watch our video on green building\u2019s impact<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>CaGBC responds to today\u2019s Canada Infrastructure Bank announcement Today at a press conference,&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":""},"cagbc_tx_theme":[422,418],"cagbc_tx_rating_standard":[38],"cagbc_tx_credit_category":[],"acf":{"sub-headline":"","byline":"","downloads":false,"related_links":false,"alt_thumb":false,"rating_systemstandard":[{"term_id":38,"name":"IREE (ICP)","slug":"iree-icp","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":38,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_rating_standard","description":"","parent":0,"count":14,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"theme":[{"term_id":418,"name":"Green Building","slug":"green-building","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":418,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_theme","description":"","parent":0,"count":85,"filter":"raw","meta":[]},{"term_id":422,"name":"Advocacy","slug":"advocacy","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":422,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_theme","description":"","parent":0,"count":70,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"credit_category":false},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.9 (Yoast SEO v21.9) -
