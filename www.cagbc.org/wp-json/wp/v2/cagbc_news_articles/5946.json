The goal of the certification is to increase investor confidence by providing third-party verification retrofit projects meet desired energy targets. Project developers using IREE benefit from a consistent, best-practice approach to project development that better ensures outcomes and facilitates financing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the first certified building financed by one of the CIB\u2019s large-scale decarbonization investments, Dream\u2019s 366 Bay St. redevelopment represents an important milestone and one of many retrofit projects to come that will be IREE certified. The CIB\u2019s initiative finances the capital costs of retrofits, using energy savings and operating cost savings for repayment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The building is part of a group of <a href=\"https:\/\/cib-bic.ca\/en\/projects\/green-infrastructure\/dream-retrofits\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">19 Dream properties in Ontario and Saskatchewan<\/a> which received a $136.6 million investment from the CIB. The building retrofits will see approximately 1,500 jobs created and the decarbonization and modernization of buildings where 15,000 employees work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CIB is having a transformative effect on the infrastructure market by providing access to financing for energy retrofits and leading the way for private investment. By requiring IREE certification, the CIB is encouraging a standardized process of developing and financing projects and helping to establish energy retrofit investments as a distinct asset class.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-quote-carousel wp-block-quote-carousel--large spacing-top-3 slickjs\"><div class=\"slickjs__track\"><div class=\"slickjs__slide\"><blockquote class=\"spacing-top-0 spacing-bottom-0\"><div class=\"has-h-5-font-size has-medium-grey-color\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our green infrastructure investments are expediting the decarbonization of buildings across Canada.
