Worldwide, buildings are responsible for 37% of energy related carbon emissions and 34% of energy demand (Source GlobalABC Status Report 2022). With such a significant environmental and carbon impact, leaders and policymakers must recognise the built environment as a key agent of change to close the 1.5\u00b0C gap. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WorldGBC and its network have launched the \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/worldgbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/WorldGBC-Global-Policy-Principles_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Global Policy Principles for a Sustainable Built Environment<\/a>&#8221;, to support policymakers around the world adopt a holistic approach to built environment sustainability, and ensure that new and updated policies and legislations deliver the transformative action needed to reach the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull is-light is-style-banner-ads\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;min-height:285px\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-cover__background has-light-grey-background-color has-background-dim-100 has-background-dim\"><\/span><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-607\" alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/banner-LEED-hours-scaled.webp\" style=\"object-position:54% 38%\" data-object-fit=\"cover\" data-object-position=\"54% 38%\"\/><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-default\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https:\/\/worldgbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/WorldGBC-Global-Policy-Principles_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Download the report<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignfull is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\" style=\"margin-top:0\">\n<p>The principles are structured around seven key focus areas: carbon, resilience, circularity, water, biodiversity, health, equity and access. These areas are supported by detailed policy levers to show how they can be effectively implemented through regulation, information and incentives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know from the most recent IPCC report that current government policies will see warming exceed 1.5\u00b0C during the 21st century \u2013 causing irreversible harm to the environment and our most vulnerable members of society.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being the largest contributing sector to carbon emissions, the building and construction industry is still not on track to achieve total decarbonisation by 2050 (Source GlobalABC Status Report 2022); meaning the gap between actual climate performance of the sector and its pathway to decarbonisation is widening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This creates a dual challenge for the built environment \u2014 with markets in Asia and Africa expecting their building stock to double by mid-century.
