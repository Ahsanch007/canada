Under LEED v4, these projects generally follow the Group certification pathway, as outlined in USGBC\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usgbc.org\/resources\/leed-campus-guidance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LEED Campus Guidance <\/a>and the applicable reference guides. The Group approach allows project teams to address each prerequisite and credit requirement with one response for the project site, though there are some requirements that must still be met for each building individually within the Group certification, as noted in the guidance.
