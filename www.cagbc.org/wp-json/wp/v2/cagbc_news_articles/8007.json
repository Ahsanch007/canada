Presented in memory of a visionary green building advocate, the award goes to a student project that demonstrates leadership, innovation, and a creative vision for the future of sustainable design in the field of green building and communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:63%\">\n<p>The 2023 award went to a student team led by Danielle Arciaga from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Simon Fraser University (SFU)<\/a> for an ambitious project: the decarbonization of the Discovery 1 Building at SFU\u2019s Burnaby campus. The project\u2019s aim was to help SFU reduce their operational GHG emissions to 50 percent of 2007 levels by 2025. The team explored different retrofit approaches and how they affect building energy efficiency and carbon emissions, and explored related economic opportunities while giving back to the SFU community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aligned with the university\u2019s 2025 Sustainability Plan, this project consisted of an Energy Conservations Measure (ECM) study that considered the building\u2019s major components, namely the mechanical system, lighting system, building envelope, on-site renewable energy generation, and building automation. A concept map was used to brainstorm different ECMs and weigh them against specific selection criteria, with emission reduction as the main goal along with minimizing the building\u2019s energy demand. Various methods were considered to reduce the energy demand, such as occupant awareness, continuous commissioning of the building, and efficient mechanical systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:37%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Andy-Kesteloo-winners-2023-EN-808x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8026\" style=\"width:341px;height:433px\" width=\"341\" height=\"433\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Andy-Kesteloo-winners-2023-EN-808x1024.jpg 808w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Andy-Kesteloo-winners-2023-EN-237x300.jpg 237w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Andy-Kesteloo-winners-2023-EN-768x974.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Andy-Kesteloo-winners-2023-EN-1211x1536.jpg 1211w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Andy-Kesteloo-winners-2023-EN-1615x2048.jpg 1615w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Andy-Kesteloo-winners-2023-EN.jpg 1880w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>A list of ECMs was created and a selection was made using a weighted decision matrix. Regulations such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/nrc.canada.ca\/en\/certifications-evaluations-standards\/codes-canada\/codes-canada-publications\/national-energy-code-canada-buildings-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">National Energy Code for Buildings (NECB)<\/a>, the British Columbia Building Code, and British Columbia Step Code were considered when assessing the ECMs to ensure the requirements for building compliance are met, as well as industry standards such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ashrae.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ASHRAE<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.energystar.gov\/?s=mega\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Energy Star ratings<\/a>. Upon reviewing building drawings and mechanical systems, and considering the regulations in place, ECMs were developed to address insulation, windows, and mechanical system improvements. The final list of ECMs were reflected in a 3D model and a baseline model including building schematic, mechanical drawings, and utility data was developed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By incorporating the recommended ECMs for SFU\u2019s Discovery 1 building, the team found that insulation, windows, and mechanical fuel switching are deep retrofits capable of reducing energy use and GHG emissions within a building, increasing thermal comfort and contributing to SFU\u2019s 2025 Sustainability Plan. A model was created to justify the ECM recommendations along with a Climate Risk Assessment for further plans to improve the performance of the building.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt is great to see students combine theory and practice on real-life projects and participate in greening the buildings they actually use\u201d, said CAGBC President and CEO Thomas Mueller. \u201cThe scope of this project is similar to projects completed by professional firms and that\u2019s just additional evidence that sustainability students can be change agents before graduating.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This project demonstrates leadership by using the latest studies and best practices incorporated by building performance consultants. Its scope and replicable framework will serve as a blueprint for similar buildings looking to decarbonize effectively. With a collaborative approach and commitment to excellence, this SFU team managed to complete a comprehensive study that will have an immediate impact on an existing building. Congratulations to the project team on this award.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Winning Project Title: Deep Retrofit Study for SFU &#8211; Exploring Energy Conservation
