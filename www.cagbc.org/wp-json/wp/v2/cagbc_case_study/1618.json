As they designed a high performance building, the embodied carbon in the building materials became more important. The analysis showed that the aluminum window frames, steel structure and concrete components had the greatest impacts due to the carbon intensity of the manufacturing process and the volume of materials used.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"designed-for-comfort-and-energy-efficiency\">Designed for comfort and energy efficiency<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The school board\u2019s goal was to create a comfortable learning environment and to provide an exemplary building for students that could also be used as a learning tool. One of the tools will be a television that broadcasts the school\u2019s daily energy consumption and production, including the energy produced via photovoltaic solar panels. In science class, students will learn how GHGs can be reduced using technologies found in the school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The schoolyard design includes as many trees as possible, additional green space, and enhanced views from the classrooms, which has proven to be beneficial to student learning. An important feature of the interior design is the addition of wood furniture that will be integrated throughout the building. The project also supports low carbon transportation such as safe pedestrian access, bicycle racks, public transit access and parking spaces for electric vehicles.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>First project in Quebec to receive CAGBC Zero Carbon Building \u2013 Design certification&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2470,"template":"","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":""},"cagbc_tx_rating_standard":[388],"cagbc_tx_system_version":[50],"cagbc_tx_building_type":[56],"cagbc_tx_certification_level":[],"acf":{"street_address":"43 Rue St-Laurent","city":"Saint-Eustache","province":"Quebec","downloads":false,"related_links":false,"rating_systemstandard":[{"term_id":388,"name":"Zero Carbon Building","slug":"zero-carbon-building","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":388,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_rating_standard","description":"","parent":0,"count":62,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"system_version":[{"term_id":50,"name":"ZCB-Design","slug":"zcb-design","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":50,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_system_version","description":"","parent":0,"count":17,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"certification_level":false,"building_type":[{"term_id":56,"name":"Schools","slug":"schools","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":56,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_building_type","description":"","parent":0,"count":3,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"alt_thumb":false},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.9 (Yoast SEO v21.9) -
