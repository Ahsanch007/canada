Originally built in 1989, the five-story, 4,487&nbsp;m<sup>2<\/sup>&nbsp;building was notorious for being cold in the winter, and hot in the summer\u2014not a great atmosphere for the administrative staff whose offices are located there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to funding to help the college reduce GHG emissions, a deep retrofit was undertaken addressing both the building envelope and upgrades to its systems. As a result, the renovated building will use 70 per cent less energy than before, making it not only the College\u2019s most energy efficient building, but also one of the most energy efficient in North America.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignfull has-cloud-white-color has-charcoal-grey-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-elements-13543f3fdb4dbf67831cd494af06808f is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\"><h3 class=\"spacing-bottom-3\">Project Team<\/h3><div class=\"wp-custom-grid wp-custom-grid--three-col\"><dl class=\"spacing-top-0 spacing-bottom-0\"><dt>Owner<\/dt><dd>Humber College<\/dd><\/dl><dl class=\"spacing-top-0 spacing-bottom-0\"><dt>Architect<\/dt><dd>B+H<\/dd><\/dl><dl class=\"spacing-top-0 spacing-bottom-0\"><dt>Sustainability Consultant<\/dt><dd>Morrison Hershfield<\/dd><\/dl><dl class=\"spacing-top-0 spacing-bottom-0\"><dt>Structural Engineer<\/dt><dd>Morrison Hershfield<\/dd><\/dl><dl class=\"spacing-top-0 spacing-bottom-0\"><dt>Electrical Engineer<\/dt><dd>Morrison Hershfield<\/dd><\/dl><dl class=\"spacing-top-0 spacing-bottom-0\"><dt>Energy Engineer<\/dt><dd>RDH<\/dd><\/dl><dl class=\"spacing-top-0 spacing-bottom-0\"><dt>Mechanical Engineer<\/dt><dd>Morrison Hershfield<\/dd><\/dl><dl class=\"spacing-top-0 spacing-bottom-0\"><dt>Contractor<\/dt><dd>BIRD Construction<\/dd><\/dl><dl class=\"spacing-top-0 spacing-bottom-0\"><dt>CaGBC members involved<\/dt><dd>BIRD Construction, B+H, Daikin, Humber College, Morrison Hershfield, RDH, and Rockwool.<\/dd><\/dl><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull is-style-banner-ads\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"has-tree-green-background-color has-background-dim-100 wp-block-cover__gradient-background has-background-dim\"><\/span><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-607\" alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/banner-LEED-hours-scaled.webp\" style=\"object-position:94% 25%\" data-object-fit=\"cover\" data-object-position=\"94% 25%\"\/><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center has-cloud-white-color has-text-color has-h-9-font-size wp-block-heading\" id=\"interested-in-learning-more\">Interested in learning more?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-default\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-cloud-white-color has-text-color\" href=\"https:\/\/portal.cagbc.org\/cagbcdocs\/zerocarbon\/CaGBC_Humber_College_Case_Study_EN.pdf\">Read this long-form case study<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignfull is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"driven-by-a-commitment-to-sustainability\">Driven by a commitment to sustainability<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Humber College\u2019s IEMP reflects the institution\u2019s sustainability focus and is integrated into every aspect of the organization. As part of its energy plan, Humber has committed to some ambitious goals, including halving its energy and water use, and reducing its GHG emissions by 30 percent, all by 2034. To achieve this, Humber is investing in industry-leading energy efficiency methodologies and new performance benchmarks, such as the Zero Carbon Building Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A retrofit to Building NX not only helps support the college\u2019s lofty sustainability goals but also would make the building more livable for the employees and students spending time there.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull is-light\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-cover__gradient-background has-background-dim\"><\/span><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2232\" height=\"764\" class=\"wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-2234\" alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/humber_college_exterior_2232x764.jpg\" data-object-fit=\"cover\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/humber_college_exterior_2232x764.jpg 2232w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/humber_college_exterior_2232x764-300x103.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/humber_college_exterior_2232x764-1024x351.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/humber_college_exterior_2232x764-768x263.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/humber_college_exterior_2232x764-1536x526.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/humber_college_exterior_2232x764-2048x701.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2232px) 100vw, 2232px\" \/><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-large-font-size\"><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignfull is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"getting-to-zero-carbon\">Getting to Zero Carbon<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Transforming Building NX into a poster child for Zero Carbon retrofits required a retrofit of the building\u2019s envelope. The original aluminum curtain walls and spandrel panels, as well as a glass vestibule were replaced to achieve the thermal energy performance requirements of CaGBC\u2019s new Zero Carbon Building Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new envelope retrofit is now highly-insulated and airtight. It features an ultra-high-performance skin and engineered transitions for superior air control to mitigate thermal bridging, especially at wall-to-window, wall-to-wall, and wall-to-roof points. In addition, new super-performance windows were installed for better energy efficiency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For mechanical systems, initial plans called for Building NX\u2019s current system to be maintained, keeping it coupled to the College\u2019s Central Utility Plant. However, because the chiller plant normally shuts down during the heating season, it would have impacted the water source Variable Refrigerant Flow-Heat recovery (VRF) system. To work around this, an air-source VRF was selected which recovers and transfers heat between zones, but exchanges heat with the ambient air instead of the plant\u2019s water loop. As a result, the building achieves a high-level of energy efficiency.<br><br>To keep the temperature consistent across the building, two new air-cooled VRF heat pumps were installed on the fifth floor, and fan-coil units were installed for each thermal zone. Given the north entrance tended to be colder in the winter months, an electric radiant flooring system was installed as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lighting systems were upgraded with a new OSRAM ENCELIUM<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>&nbsp;EXTEND Light Management System featuring sensors that communicate data to help the system run more efficiently. There is also a new photovoltaic (PV) system mounted to the roof. It\u2019s estimated that the roof PV system will generate approximately 31,500 kWh per year, more than the building will need at certain times of the year. Any excess energy will be fed into the campus central plant, to be used by other buildings.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull has-parallax is-style-banner-ads\" style=\"background-image:url(https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/bb34be5f-5eb4-3062-98d9-9df8e65f4a23.jpg)\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"has-tree-green-background-color has-background-dim-100 wp-block-cover__gradient-background has-background-dim\"><\/span><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-large-font-size\">Building NX will use 70 per cent less energy than before, making it the College\u2019s most energy efficient building, and one of the most energy efficient in North America.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignfull is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a-building-renewed\">A Building Renewed<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Building NX is completely transformed, serving as a national example of how to retrofit to zero carbon.
