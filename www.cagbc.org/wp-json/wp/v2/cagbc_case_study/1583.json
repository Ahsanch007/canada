Adhering to zero-carbon principles requires an additional level of attention to detail at every step of the design and construction process, making it even more important to have all hands on deck, Conrad noted.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull is-light\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim\"><\/span><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"300\" class=\"wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-2215\" alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/evolve1_interior_1200x300px.jpg\" data-object-fit=\"cover\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/evolve1_interior_1200x300px.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/evolve1_interior_1200x300px-300x75.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/evolve1_interior_1200x300px-1024x256.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/evolve1_interior_1200x300px-768x192.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-large-font-size\"><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"validating-the-financial-feasibility-of-zero-carbon-building\">Validating the financial feasibility of zero carbon building<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>evolv1\u2019s ZCB-Design and ZCB-Performance certifications through CAGBC are third-party validations of the Cora Group\u2019s belief that it is financially possible to build using low-carbon strategies for the same cost as conventional construction and with minimal impact on the environment, Conrad said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the energy and cost savings resulting from evolv1\u2019s zero-carbon design, The Cora Group is able to offer tenants Class-A office space in a sustainable, high-performance building, at competitive market rates. evolv1\u2019s LEED Platinum certification recognizes the building\u2019s many sustainable features that benefit occupant health and comfort, including monitored control of clean, fresh air and daylighting, managed sunlight glare, monitored humidity levels and zoned temperature control.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe all knew it was possible, but we\u2019ve now proven it is absolutely, financially possible to build a Zero Carbon commercial building, and to do it solely through private capital funding,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ZCB-Performance affirms design choices<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For the Cora Group, it was always the goal to apply for ZCB-Performance certification once the company was able to gather a year of reliable energy data, and the project team took steps to achieve this. To further validate evolv1\u2019s performance, it was important to also ensure that the building was fully occupied before starting the certification period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given evolv1 was initially designed to meet the ZCB Standard, no physical changes to the building were required, affirming the project team\u2019s vision. The team did need to work to meet evolv1\u2019s energy model target levels, by continuously monitoring and adjusting the building automation system\u2019s operating settings to manage energy use and lower consumption. With the help of data from third-party electricity meters provided by CircuitMeter, the project team was able to minimize peak demand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The evolv1 team initially encountered challenges around ensuring occupant comfort while commissioning the building\u2019s systems. At first, evolv1 used 30 percent more electricity than expected. The evolv1 team was, however, ultimately able to maintain a comfortable temperature for tenants, and additional sensors were installed to monitor and fine-tune the systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once fully commissioned, the building was able to perform as anticipated; in fact, the performance of some elements of the project have impressed many observers, including the solar wall, the actual PV energy production and the overall efficiency of the building.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, the project team was able to demonstrate that, on a sunny winter day, evolv1\u2019s solar wall is capable of heating the building\u2019s fresh air supply enough that it can leave its fresh-air heating system on bypass for significant parts of the day, with a February measurement showing the solar wall was able to heat -13 C outdoor air to 16 C.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull is-light\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim\"><\/span><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"300\" class=\"wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-2217\" alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/evolve1_interior_cafe_1200x300px.jpg\" data-object-fit=\"cover\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/evolve1_interior_cafe_1200x300px.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/evolve1_interior_cafe_1200x300px-300x75.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/evolve1_interior_cafe_1200x300px-1024x256.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/evolve1_interior_cafe_1200x300px-768x192.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-large-font-size\"><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">An eye on the future of green building<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For the Cora Group, the pursuit of ZCB Standard certifications for evolv1 represents both an investment in a greener future and an opportunity to underscore the company\u2019s history as a sustainable builder for more than a decade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFirst and foremost, we want to make a difference,\u201d Conrad said. \u201cWhen we heard about the CAGBC Zero Carbon Building certification, we saw a tremendous opportunity to measure our efforts against a progressive new building standard and to pilot our project within a program that is capturing attention from across the country and indeed, around the world.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He noted that the Cora Group\u2019s participation in the Zero Carbon Building Pilot Program has enabled the project team to learn from others who share their vision and philosophy, as well as to contribute to broader industry knowledge about low-carbon construction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with its location within Waterloo\u2019s Idea Quarter, on the doorstep of the ION Light Rail Transit system, evolv1 is gearing up to be a hub for next-generation innovation and the millennial workforce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hope, Conrad said, is that the building\u2019s dual ZCB-Design and ZCB-Performance certifications will be an important seal of approval, signalling to premier tenants that the Cora Group is a leading provider of high-quality, sustainable green spaces. It\u2019s the Cora Group\u2019s hope that this focus on sustainability will ultimately change the way procurement is done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe envision a day where zero carbon building design will be on the top of a tenant\u2019s wish list when searching for office space,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-main\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https:\/\/portal.cagbc.org\/cagbcdocs\/zerocarbon\/CaGBC_evolv1_Case_Study_EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Read CaGBC\u2019s long-form case study<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-main\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https:\/\/portal.cagbc.org\/cagbcdocs\/zerocarbon\/CaGBC_evolv1_Mitsubishi_EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Read Mitsubishi Electric Heating and Cooling case study<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"evolv1: the first Zero Carbon Building \u2013 Design Certification\" width=\"1176\" height=\"662\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/tPkC6TnA4es?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The first certified Zero Carbon Building \u2013 Design project has now achieved dual&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2214,"template":"","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":""},"cagbc_tx_rating_standard":[430,388],"cagbc_tx_system_version":[],"cagbc_tx_building_type":[62],"cagbc_tx_certification_level":[51],"acf":{"street_address":"","city":"Waterloo","province":"Ontario","downloads":false,"related_links":false,"rating_systemstandard":[{"term_id":430,"name":"LEED","slug":"leed","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":430,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_rating_standard","description":"","parent":0,"count":111,"filter":"raw","meta":[]},{"term_id":388,"name":"Zero Carbon Building","slug":"zero-carbon-building","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":388,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_rating_standard","description":"","parent":0,"count":62,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"system_version":false,"certification_level":[{"term_id":51,"name":"Platinum","slug":"platinum","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":51,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_certification_level","description":"","parent":0,"count":40,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"building_type":[{"term_id":62,"name":"Office","slug":"office","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":62,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_building_type","description":"","parent":0,"count":37,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"alt_thumb":false},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.9 (Yoast SEO v21.9) -
