story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community, which is located in the Montreal borough of Rosemont \u2013 La Petite-Patrie, received a LEED v4 Neighbourhood Development: Plan certification at the platinum level in May 2018, highlighting the project\u2019s innovative green infrastructure and its emphasis on creating a more sustainable living and work environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CaGBC spoke with Provencher_Roy, the project\u2019s architectural firm and LEED consultant, and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de D\u00e9veloppement Angus (SDA), the project\u2019s developer, about how the development builds on a

id=\"a-new-development-revitalizes-a-community\">A new development revitalizes a community<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Technop\u00f4le Angus\u2019s recent certification provides additional recognition of the neighbourhood\u2019s leadership, as the community received its first LEED-ND certification from the U.S. Green Building Council in 2008.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe wished to attain a LEED v4 ND certification because it goes hand in hand with our values, such as excellence, co-operation, solidarity, social and green innovation and environmentalism,\u201d says Marilou Hudon-Huot, Development Manager, Retail and Events for SDA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Situated on a former industrial park and brownfield, the Technop\u00f4le building portfolio includes 70,000 m<sup>2<\/sup>&nbsp;of premier commercial and residential real estate, with 62 organizations employing 2,700 workers in 13 buildings making the community their home base.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Technop\u00f4le Angus planfeatures a new 85,000 m<sup>2<\/sup>&nbsp;development that includes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>High-quality public spaces and amenities, such as a wide tree-lined pedestrian street, urban maple forest, public squares and greenbelts;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>360 residential units, 80 per cent of which will be comprised of social and affordable housing;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>45,000 m<sup>2<\/sup>&nbsp;of office space for more than 1,500 new workers;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>3,000 m<sup>2<\/sup>&nbsp;of commercial space for 20 local businesses;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A student residence, an elementary school and two public daycare centres; and<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>550 underground parking spaces, with no above-ground parking provided in order to place an emphasis on walking and cycling.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with creating jobs and providing affordable housing, the project, which will be built on a vacant lot in the heart of the community, aims to reinvigorate the public space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEvery detail has been carefully thought out to create an ideal living environment in a vibrant community with a strong connection to the surrounding neighbourhood,\u201d says C\u00e9line Mertenat, an architect with Provencher_Roy.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"utilizing-innovative-green-infrastructure-to-optimize-resource-use\">Utilizing innovative green infrastructure to optimize resource use<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The central location of the project will also allow for the deployment of an energy loop that will connect all of the Technop\u00f4le buildings. By recovering, exchanging and redistributing energy between users of the buildings\u2019 heating and cooling systems, the system is expected to drive energy savings of 40 per cent based on ASHRAE 90.1-2010 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 per cent in comparison to a conventional project without a heat exchange.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new green neighbourhood will also implement other state-of-the-art green infrastructure, including a runoff management system designed to store and filter 95 per cent of rainwater over the course of a year. Instead of entering the municipal wastewater system, the harvested rainwater will be reused by building facilities for washrooms, landscaping, gardening and so on, resulting in a 40 per cent decrease in the usage of potable water for such purposes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project\u2019s green infrastructure work includes the environmentally friendly remediation of contaminated soils on the site, left behind following the departure of the Canadian Pacific Railway locomotive repair facilities in the 1990s.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull is-light\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim\"><\/span><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"409\" class=\"wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-2502\" alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Angus_image.jpg\" style=\"object-position:50% 100%\" data-object-fit=\"cover\" data-object-position=\"50% 100%\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Angus_image.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Angus_image-300x102.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Angus_image-1024x349.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Angus_image-768x262.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-large-font-size\"><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"envisioning-a-car-free-zone\">Envisioning a car-free zone<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A particularly notable aspect of the planned Technop\u00f4le Angus expansion is that while there will be underground parking available and easy access to alternative means of transport, there will be no street-level parking and no motor vehicles circulating around the site. The intentionis to completely reserve the ground level for pedestrians, cyclists and vegetation, and to promote health and well-being through active transportation and biodiversity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These features are meant to create a network of comfortable, high-quality public spaces in support of the project\u2019s goals of allowing the community to take full ownership of the site and create a more sustainable lifestyle for both residents and workers.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"upholding-high-performance-standards-and-long-term-sustainability\">Upholding high performance standards and long-term sustainability<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For the Technop\u00f4le Angus project team, the achievement of LEED v4 certification demonstrates the development\u2019s adherence to high performance standards and helps to anchor the project to a long-term vision of sustainability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project creates a network of comfortable, high-quality public spaces in support of the project\u2019s goals of allowing the community to take full ownership of the site and create a more sustainable lifestyle for both residents and workers.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"214\" height=\"214\" src=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/LEED_Certified_Certified_Web.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/LEED_Certified_Certified_Web.png 214w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/LEED_Certified_Certified_Web-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-tree-green-color has-text-color has-h-8-font-size\" id=\"leed-score-card\">LEED SCORE CARD<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><th class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">Certification Level<\/th><th class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">Rating System<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">Platinum<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">LEED v4 ND: Plan<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Billed as both a green neighbourhood and an employment hub aimed at attracting&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2501,"template":"","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":""},"cagbc_tx_rating_standard":[430,34],"cagbc_tx_system_version":[48],"cagbc_tx_building_type":[67],"cagbc_tx_certification_level":[51],"acf":{"street_address":"","city":"Montreal","province":"Quebec","downloads":false,"related_links":false,"rating_systemstandard":[{"term_id":430,"name":"LEED","slug":"leed","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":430,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_rating_standard","description":"","parent":0,"count":111,"filter":"raw","meta":[]},{"term_id":34,"name":"LEED v4","slug":"leed-v4","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":34,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_rating_standard","description":"","parent":0,"count":99,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"system_version":[{"term_id":48,"name":"Cities+Communities","slug":"leed-cities-communities","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":48,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_system_version","description":"","parent":0,"count":4,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"certification_level":[{"term_id":51,"name":"Platinum","slug":"platinum","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":51,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_certification_level","description":"","parent":0,"count":40,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"building_type":[{"term_id":67,"name":"Mixed-use","slug":"mixed-use","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":67,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_building_type","description":"","parent":0,"count":13,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"alt_thumb":false},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.9 (Yoast SEO v21.9) -
