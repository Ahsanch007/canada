The result is a design that clearly demonstrates innovative and forward-thinking design, including these features which made it stand out to CAGBC\u2019s reviewers:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A rooftop photovoltaic (PV) system that produces 500kWp AC, enough carbon-free energy to power the new building.<\/li><li>A high-performance building envelope consisting of triple-pane glazing and insulated pre-cast sandwich panels, helping to minimize thermal energy demand intensity (TEDI) while maximizing heating, cooling and natural light.<\/li><li>A variable refrigerant flow (VRF) geoexchange heat pump system that will provide space heating and cooling.<\/li><li>The JCPI also uses no natural gas onsite \u2013 the all-electric set up allows for the easiest route to low carbon for most buildings.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, the college is playing a key role in advancing the zero-carbon building industry through its active support of the ZCB Standard, particularly as one of only three education institutions across Canada to be named as a pilot project for the Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMohawk College is a strong believer in leading by example and particularly by our efforts in sustainability,\u201d says Tony Cupido, Mohawk College\u2019s Chief Building and Facilities Officer. \u201cOur integrated design team was fully committed to this certification and we now feel a strong sense of achievement. This Standard provides an exemplary level of achievement that is a testimony to the effort of our Mohawk project team.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignfull has-cloud-white-color has-charcoal-grey-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-elements-a360bf619ae8accff25c732294922cbd is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\"><h3 class=\"spacing-bottom-3\">Awards<\/h3><div class=\"wp-custom-grid wp-custom-grid--three-col\"><dl class=\"spacing-top-0 spacing-bottom-0\"><dt>2018 Engineering Project of the Year<\/dt><dd>Ontario Society of Professional Engineers<\/dd><\/dl><dl class=\"spacing-top-0 spacing-bottom-0\"><dt>2018 Environmental Sustainability Award<\/dt><dd>Alectra Energy Evolution Summit<\/dd><\/dl><dl class=\"spacing-top-0 spacing-bottom-0\"><dt>2018 Sustainable Project of the Year<\/dt><dd>Ontario Sustainable Energy Association<\/dd><\/dl><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-style-default is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"more-than-just-a-bold-new-architectural-landmark\">More than just a bold new architectural landmark<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Joyce Centre for Partnership and Innovation will build on Mohawk\u2019s applied research strengths in three primary areas of health, energy and technology. Leveraging existing and new partnerships, this space will focus on technologically advanced learning and lab spaces, all under one roof. The new building embodies Mohawk&#8217;s vision to be the environmental leader its students, staff and partners expect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed to meet the highest green standards, the JCPI will also be a net-zero energy building, producing as much or more energy than it consumes. It will be entirely dedicated to the student experience and expand on experiential learning at Mohawk. Students will enjoy greater access to laboratories, and the opportunity to learn through capstone projects, industry placements, co-op work terms, applied research and development, and team competitions. This will supply much-needed graduates to industry partners and magnify the college\u2019s regional economic impact.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull is-light\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim\"><\/span><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"426\" class=\"wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-2180\" alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/20170214_E_Wing_Wall_Wrap_3_web.jpg\" data-object-fit=\"cover\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/20170214_E_Wing_Wall_Wrap_3_web.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/20170214_E_Wing_Wall_Wrap_3_web-300x107.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/20170214_E_Wing_Wall_Wrap_3_web-1024x364.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/20170214_E_Wing_Wall_Wrap_3_web-768x273.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-large-font-size\"><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"designed-for-work-integrated-learning\">Designed for work-integrated learning<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With its infrastructure left intentionally exposed, the Joyce Centre for Partnership and Innovation will be a living lab for students, faculty and industry partners.
