The facility caters to Canada\u2019s hockey obsessed culture, with facilities designed to help athletes reach their optimum performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This focus on high performance goes beyond the athletes AMPED serves to the facility itself. Thanks to an energy overhaul led by Modern Niagara Group Inc., AMPED is the first Zero Carbon Building \u2013 Performance certified arena under CAGBC&#8217;s Zero Carbon Building Standard Program.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignfull has-cloud-white-color has-charcoal-grey-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-elements-bc2877e55581f2b940004e46757b759e is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\"><h3 class=\"spacing-bottom-3\">Project Team<\/h3><div class=\"wp-custom-grid wp-custom-grid--three-col\"><dl class=\"spacing-top-0 spacing-bottom-0\"><dt>Project Owner<\/dt><dd>AMPED Sports Lab &#038; Ice Complex<\/dd><\/dl><dl class=\"spacing-top-0 spacing-bottom-0\"><dt>LEED \/ Sustainability Consultant<\/dt><dd>Modern Niagara Engineering<\/dd><\/dl><dl class=\"spacing-top-0 spacing-bottom-0\"><dt>Mechanical Engineer<\/dt><dd>Modern Niagara Engineering<\/dd><\/dl><dl class=\"spacing-top-0 spacing-bottom-0\"><dt>Electrical Engineer<\/dt><dd>Paragon Engineering Services<\/dd><\/dl><dl class=\"spacing-top-0 spacing-bottom-0\"><dt>Commissioning Authority<\/dt><dd>Modern Niagara Engineering<\/dd><\/dl><dl class=\"spacing-top-0 spacing-bottom-0\"><dt>CGABC members involved<\/dt><dd><a href=\"https:\/\/modernniagara.com\/\">Modern Niagara<\/a><\/dd><\/dl><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignfull is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"building-for-life\">Building for life<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a multi-disciplinary contractor, Modern Niagara specializes in mechanical, electrical, building controls and building services. Over the past 20 years, Modern Niagara has focused on analyzing, developing, and implementing energy conservation measures for all types of buildings. As a contractor and CAGBC member, Modern Niagara is conscious of the impact of buildings on carbon emissions \u2013 and the role buildings must play in helping Canada meet its climate targets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Modern Niagara team saw AMPED Sports Lab as a challenge. Arenas are traditionally one of the most energy intensive buildings \u2013 particularly when operating during the warmer summer months. Addressing energy upgrades by transitioning away from fossil fuels to earn Zero Carbon Building \u2013 Performance certification gave Modern Niagara the opportunity to push the envelope and set a new standard for these specialized building types.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cRecognizing that every building is unique, the path to a zero carbon building is also unique. If a hockey and sports-dedicated facility in a city where temperatures vary by over 40 degrees can become zero carbon, imagine the possibilities for other buildings across Canada and around the world,\u201d said Brad McAninch, CEO, Modern Niagara Group Inc.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull is-style-default\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim\"><\/span><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"300\" class=\"wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-2178\" alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/amped_solar.jpg\" data-object-fit=\"cover\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/amped_solar.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/amped_solar-300x75.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/amped_solar-1024x256.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/amped_solar-768x192.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-large-font-size\"><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"moving-beyond-fossil-fuels\">Moving beyond fossil fuels<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The AMPED Sports Lab caters to elite athletic training, as well as recovery and treatment of injuries or chronic problems. It houses a physiotherapy clinic, a gym and a 120\u2019 by 65\u2019 ice rink \u2013 a perfect size for skills development and custom training for hockey players of all ages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To earn the ZCB-Performance certification, Modern Niagara took an aggressive path and targeted all mechanical systems that consumed natural gas, and consequently emitted carbon into the atmosphere \u2013 including the ice rink dehumidifier, the hot water heater, and the rooftop air handling units.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All fossil fuel consumption related to building energy use was eliminated on-site and converted to electric-based alternatives. To achieve their goal, custom-designed and built rooftop units (RTUs) were manufactured with heat pumps and electric heat backup instead of the traditional direct expansion (DX) coil and gas-fired burner. The ice arena dehumidification system was also retrofitted with a unique, custom-built liquid dessicant air-conditioned unit, equipped with refrigeration DX system reheat. These custom units helped to drastically reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while also providing the highest possible efficiency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To better manage building performance, including the ice-making process, a robust automation and metering system was installed. Used in combination with a real-time analytics software package, it optimizes building and process control and performance, enhances maintenance services, and assists in the continuous commissioning of the facility in order to ensure energy savings persist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chiller system that is used to make ice for the rink also had an energy optimization automation system installed to ensure run times and sequencing are automatically adjusted to drive efficiencies. Heat reclaim from the Ammonia-based chiller was considered however the return on investment was excessive for the low amount of high-temperature heat available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lighting systems were retrofitted to high-efficiency LED, and to provide clean electricity a 136 kW solar photovoltaic array was installed.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a-first-for-ice-arenas-everywhere\">A first for ice arenas everywhere<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern Niagara\u2019s approach to sustainability led them to the Zero Carbon Building Standard. As an organization, they saw ZCB-Performance certification as a way to demonstrate the importance of GHG reductions while improving energy efficiency. The project targeted a 20 per cent improvement in energy efficiency and a 70% reduction in carbon emissions. While the approach can lead to slightly higher utility operating cost today, the project was able to reduce exposure to rising carbon prices, and significantly reduce climate impacts\u2014a key factor for the Modern Niagara team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOther types of certifications tend to focus only on energy efficiency, but do not adequately capture the cost to the environment,\u201d said McAninch. \u201cThe Zero Carbon Building Standard helps us meaningfully contribute to our sustainability goals and reduces our impact on the environment, which is important to our organization and staff. We expect this project will increase tenant satisfaction and provide unique education opportunities around zero carbon buildings.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong><em>What we have accomplished at AMPED Sports Lab and Ice Complex represents a step towards building a more sustainable future.
