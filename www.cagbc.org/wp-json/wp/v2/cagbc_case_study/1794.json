It is conveniently located next to major highways and on the subway system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following case study was written using responses previously provided for a LEED Spotlight in February 2016.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignfull is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"renewing-building-systems-for-better-performance\">Renewing building systems for better performance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2010, building management identified the goal of reaching REALpac\u2019s \u201c20 by 2015\u201d goal of reducing normalized energy consumption to under 20 ekWh\/ft2\/year for each of the three buildings in the Yonge Corporate Centre complex. In order to reach their energy targets, management staff assembled an integrated building performance team to help ensure decisions are made with target performance in mind, problems are solved collectively, and that staff and tenants are educated on the building and its systems. Ongoing tracking also enables them to provide feedback to all stakeholders on progress and allow for adjustments and corrections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team focused their improvement efforts for certification on making the best of existing, high quality building systems and equipment. Boiler burners have been replaced with up-to-date technology, variable frequency drives were installed on the original ventilation systems and building automation programming was comprehensively upgraded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By working together, they were able to attain ENERGY STAR scores in the 90s, divert 88 per cent of their overall waste from landfill, and create a healthy environment for all who work at Yonge Corporate Centre. Overall, the complex has also saved 24.3% in total energy compared with the 2010 baseline.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur building performance is a testament to our desire to collaborate with our tenants and our team,\u201d says Patricia Poyntz, General Manager, of Yonge Corporate Centre. \u201cTogether, we\u2019ve been able to make smart decisions that impact our people, our tenants and the environment \u2014 for the better. As we look forward to the coming year, we will be building on our current achievements and exploring ways to reduce our water consumption.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"meeting-tenants-needs-a-key-focus\">Meeting tenants needs a key focus<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cadillac Fairview\u2019s Green at Work program also identifies goals for the five pillars of sustainability: Energy, Waste Management, Environmental Protection (land, air and water), Sustainable Procurement, and Stakeholder Collaboration, which Yonge Corporate Centre has been working steadily to attain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to do this, they\u2019ve established an environmental sustainability program where their goals align with those of their tenants, achieve savings from which they directly benefit, and ultimately deliver better value. Further, they continue to monitor and measure their efforts to ensure that they are consistently meeting the goals that were set and providing the ongoing value their tenants expect. The Yonge Corporate Centre Operations team works closely with tenants to reduce energy use in their spaces. For one tenant, they assisted in making the business case for lighting replacement, acquired the correct lamps and tracked the savings realized. The project cost approximately $3000; however the tenant is now saving $1,750 a year for a simple payback of 1.2 years, including incentives. Even more importantly, the retrofit improved working conditions at the reception desk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way they\u2019ve engaged with tenants is through an \u201cEnergy Challenge\u201d they conducted through an evening audit of tenant spaces, and then comparing it with floor-by-floor interval meter results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis gave us great insight into where we could improve plug load and lighting efficiency to save energy after regular working hours,\u201d says Poyntz. \u201cTo turn these insights into action, we challenged occupants in each building to reduce their office energy use. By shutting off lights, unplugging chargers and turning off monitors, some floors were able to save up to 7% of their energy use. Each floor that was able to save energy was rewarded with a local ice cream treat.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"additional-tenant-incentives-and-sustainability-initiatives\">Additional tenant incentives and sustainability initiatives<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ditching the drive<\/strong><br>For nearly 40 per cent of Yonge Corporate Centre tenants and occupants, the TTC is the better way for transportation. Of those who elect to drive, 10 per cent share the ride with at least one other person. To help Yonge Corporate Centre tenants and occupants ditch their drive in favour of a more environmentally friendly alternative, they offer bicycle racks at the entrance of each building and on the second parking level, as well as Zip Car service in the parking lot for attending meetings or running errands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Experiencing the Outdoors: Counting butterflies<\/strong><br>For those who love to walk or sit outside, Yonge Corporate Centre offers year-round outdoor seating, new walkways around the buildings, and access to a number of trails. Occupants can enjoy the fresh air and butterfly-friendly plants throughout the grounds that attract more than 100 species of butterflies living in the Toronto area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Greening for the Birds<\/strong><br>For several years, the Yonge Corporate Centre has been working closely with the Convenience Group to create a more bird-friendly environment. In 2012, they applied a new film technology to the north side of 4120 Yonge that had been developed over 10 years with the help of leading ornithologists. The test film has proven to be 100 per cent successful in reducing migratory bird collisions where it has been applied. The film has been installed on 4100 Yonge Street and 4110 Yonge Street, helping make Yonge Corporate Centre a safer place for migratory birds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Environmental
