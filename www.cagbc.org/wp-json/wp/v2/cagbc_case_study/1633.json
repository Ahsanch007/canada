In comparing the various residential building certification programs, the pair note that Passive House was a definite contender, but among the homes they visited that were built to that standard, not all of the homeowners were satisfied. When LEED v4 was announced, they had already done some research about the rating system and found they preferred LEED because of its holistic approach towards a healthy and autonomous lifestyle, which fit in with their priorities as baby boomers. The resulting home was one that hit all the checkmarks for LEED v4, while also incorporating passive design features.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<aside class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull has-parallax is-style-banner-ads\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-cover__background has-tree-green-background-color has-background-dim-100 has-background-dim\"><\/span><div role=\"img\" class=\"wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-827 has-parallax\" style=\"background-position:50% 50%;background-image:url(https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/gurpreet-singh-Yupt0-fHaEE-unsplash-scaled.jpg)\"><\/div><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-large-font-size\"><strong>Chevrier and Rh\u00e9aume found they preferred LEED because of its&nbsp;holistic approach towards a healthy and autonomous lifestyle, which fit in with their priorities as baby boomers.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div><\/aside>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignfull is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>The couple received their initiation into the green building culture through seminars and classes on the topic, which they say allowed them to ask principal industry stakeholders the right questions, and to learn first-hand about which practices were authentic and which were greenwashing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Chevrier and Rh\u00e9aume soon realized that the project also presented many opportunities to work with local tradespeople and to demonstrate to them how sustainable building can be viable even for small contractors. The pair were able to demonstrate that green building practices and materials do not necessarily add exorbitant cost overruns. This was important, as employing local labour and buying local products were key components of their LEED v4 certification given the home\u2019s geographical isolation in eastern Quebec.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"living-in-a-leed-v4-home-is-priceless\">Living in a LEED v4 home is \u2018priceless\u2019<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every effort for the L\u2019Heure Bleue project was focused on ecological awareness, sustainable materials and environmental management, both indoors and outdoors, Chevrier and Rh\u00e9aume say. Energy consumption is fully monitored, and the home incorporates components from both the WaterSense and ENERGY STAR programs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the project\u2019s other features include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Highly insulated and airtight building envelope<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>An air exchanger and opening windows on the river-facing side of the house<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>ENERGY STAR-qualified and EnerGuide-rated appliances selected for efficiency<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>LED and natural lighting<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rainwater harvesting and well water usage<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A rain garden, xeriscaping, food forest and permaculture<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A white clover lawn<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The couple note they are already seeing savings and other advantages after just seven months of living in their new home, with low operational costs in areas such as hydro and water consumption, and health benefits due to an indoor environment with clean air quality and no VOC emissions, natural lighting and air circulation. Their hydro bill of less than $60 a month is a fraction of the cost incurred at their previous house, and despite using their heat pump\/air conditioning infrequently, the house is kept cool during the summer and comfortably warm without overheating during the -34 C winters. In addition, the marketability and sales appeal of these green features represents an increase in market value. \u201cThis is a house with a profitable future,\u201d they say. \u201cIt will be sustainable for many generations to come.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Savings aside, owning a LEED v4 certified home is priceless, Chevrier and Rh\u00e9aume say. \u201cWe are still amazed that in this era of social environmental consciousness, people ask us why we chose this route \u2026 What monetary value can you put on ethics or social values?\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a-win-win-for-homebuilders-and-local-trades\">A win-win for homebuilders and local trades<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with being an enriching learning opportunity that gave them hands-on experience with the construction industry, trades and resources, Chevrier and Rh\u00e9aume were also able to leverage their personal background to bring valuable contributions to the table. This included sharing their demographics\u2019 specific \u2013 and sometimes overlooked \u2013 needs, and highlighting the potential for baby boomer homebuilders, in a housing market that often seems to focus on young families and millennials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often in local construction there can be a closed culture that relies on timeworn procedures that don\u2019t consider new approaches or innovation. By employing their newfound knowledge in green building, Chevrier and Rh\u00e9aume were able to inject some fresh thinking into the process. For example, when discussing LEED v4 requirements with the project team, they realized that they were not only leading the discussion in some cases, but also teaching them about new building methods learned through their LEED for Homes Provider \u00c9cohabitation, who had helped guide them through the LEED green building process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also note that while it was important for them to be clear and not compromise on their expectations, they often encountered win-win situations relating to product selection, installation and site management, in which contractors or tradespeople were surprised to realize they were already using green products or methods. Those who had to make changes realized they were feasible and responded accordingly, Chevrier and Rh\u00e9aume say, especially given the benefits of being part of a project that was receiving lots of attention from the industry due to the couple\u2019s blog and word of mouth.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull is-light\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim\"><\/span><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"225\" class=\"wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-2527\" alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/lheure_bleue_de_charlevoix.jpg\" data-object-fit=\"cover\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/lheure_bleue_de_charlevoix.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/lheure_bleue_de_charlevoix-300x56.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/lheure_bleue_de_charlevoix-1024x192.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/lheure_bleue_de_charlevoix-768x144.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-large-font-size\"><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a-rewarding-experience-despite-challenges\">A rewarding experience despite challenges<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Chevrier and Rh\u00e9aume say they found the LEED v4 rating system to be very clear and able to be used as a construction checklist, there were still a few hurdles in pursuing certification and in the construction process in general. Given their rural location, it was not feasible to obtain a few of the credits focusing on access to urban infrastructure such as transit. They also had to work through issues related to using verified sustainable materials and resources in the project, such as their cement provider being unable to guarantee that the recycled content they used from a demolished cement overpass did not contain pyrite.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given this was a self-build project, the couple were responsible for managing the construction site, which was made more challenging by building during a brutal -36 C winter. Meanwhile, architectural elements had to comply not only with environmental and regional priorities, but also with the architectural heritage of the area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, despite the demanding nature of the project, the pair say they found it to be a rewarding experience: \u201cWe would do it again in a heartbeat.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a-new-passion-for-green-living\">A new passion for green living<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For Chevrier and Rh\u00e9aume, their retirement project has inspired a passion for sustainable, holistic living and a change in lifestyle, which they hope to share with others. \u201cDo it and don\u2019t look back,\u201d they say. \u201cYou can\u2019t be half green or half eco.\u201d This LEED Platinum certification also proves that sustainable building can be achieved at the grassroots level. \u201cThis home was not built by a turnkey contractor or a corporation. It was built by someone\u2019s Mom and Dad, Grandma and Grandpa.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was something they leveraged as part of their experience, through networking with other homeowners who have built LEED or Passive House homes. These conversations were a precious resource, with the couple observing that people were openly honest with them about their experiences and were willing to share data and anecdotes that helped them with their choices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping in line with that, if there is a bit of wisdom Chevrier and Rh\u00e9aume can share with others interested in building a LEED home, it would be to remember that they are building their home, not a demonstration house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t overdesign or overconsult with engineers, manufacturers, contractors or suppliers. Trust your instinct. People will become interested in your project and some will see it as the golden opportunity to test out their products, knowledge or procedures using your time and budget.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cLEED v4 is a good template \u2013 but it\u2019s up to you to know how you will use it under the guidance of professionals and other stakeholders. At the end of the day, you must be happy with what you have achieved, because it is your path and your destination.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To read more about L\u2019Heure Bleue de Charlevoix, visit the project blog at&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/construiremaisonecocharlevoix.blogspot.com\/\">construiremaisonecocharlevoix.blogspot.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull has-parallax is-style-banner-ads\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-cover__background has-tree-green-background-color has-background-dim-100 has-background-dim\"><\/span><div role=\"img\" class=\"wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-827 has-parallax\" style=\"background-position:50% 50%;background-image:url(https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/gurpreet-singh-Yupt0-fHaEE-unsplash-scaled.jpg)\"><\/div><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-large-font-size\"><strong>This home was not built by a turnkey contractor or a corporation.&nbsp;It was built by someone\u2019s Mom and Dad, Grandma and Grandpa<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"214\" height=\"214\" src=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/LEED_Certified_Certified_Web.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/LEED_Certified_Certified_Web.png 214w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/LEED_Certified_Certified_Web-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-tree-green-color has-text-color has-h-8-font-size\" id=\"leed-score-card\">LEED SCORE CARD<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><th class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">Certification Level<\/th><th class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">Rating System<\/th><th class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">Total Points earned<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">Platinum<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">LEED v4 for Building Design and Construction: Homes and Multifamily Lowrise<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">80.5<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignfull has-cloud-white-color has-charcoal-grey-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-elements-87304769f56e0dde1489c20a71a87967 is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-content-justification-left is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-layout-19 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\" style=\"padding-top:0;padding-right:0;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-layout-10 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\" style=\"padding-top:0;padding-right:0;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left has-h-3-font-size\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-weight:900\">2 out of 2<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left has-h-4-font-size\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-weight:400\">Integrative Process<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-layout-11 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\" style=\"padding-top:0;padding-right:0;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0\">\n<p class=\"has-h-3-font-size\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-weight:900\">3 out of 15<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left has-h-4-font-size\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-weight:400\">Location &amp;
