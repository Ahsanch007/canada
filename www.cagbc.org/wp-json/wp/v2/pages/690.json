The initial version of the Standard was published in May 2017.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Updates to the Zero Carbon Building Standards were developed using the following guiding principles, established by the Zero Carbon Steering Committee:<br>\u2022 Prioritize carbon emissions reductions<br>\u2022 Ensure energy efficient design<br>\u2022 Encourage good grid citizenship<br>\u2022 Incentivize reductions in embodied carbon<br>\u2022 Keep it simple and accessible<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Revisions to the Standard have been informed by the initial pilot program, subsequent years of market feedback, as well as changing market expectations related to operational and embodied carbon emissions. The Zero Carbon Steering Committee oversaw the changes to the Standards, with the support of Working Groups and the CAGBC\u2019s Energy &amp; Engineering Technical Advisory Group.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<\/div><\/details><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-genesis-blocks-gb-accordion gb-block-accordion\"><details><summary class=\"gb-accordion-title\">How is a zero-carbon building defined?<\/summary><div class=\"gb-accordion-text\">\n<p>A zero-carbon building is a highly energy-efficient building that produces onsite, or procures, carbon-free renewable energy or high-quality carbon offsets, in an amount sufficient to offset the annual carbon emissions associated with building materials and operations. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/our-work\/certification\/zero-carbon-building-standard\/zero-carbon-building-standard-performance-resources\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Learn more<\/a> in the opening pages of the Zero Carbon Building Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<\/div><\/details><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-genesis-blocks-gb-accordion gb-block-accordion\"><details><summary class=\"gb-accordion-title\">What project types can use the Zero Carbon Building Standard?<\/summary><div class=\"gb-accordion-text\">\n<p>CAGBC\u2019s Zero Carbon Building standards provide two pathways for certification \u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/our-work\/certification\/zero-carbon-building-standard\/zero-carbon-building-standard-performance-resources\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Performance<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/our-work\/certification\/zero-carbon-building-standard\/zcb-design-resources\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Design<\/a>.

In Canada, building construction and operations must effectively eliminate greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions to meet the national target of carbon neutrality by 2050. CAGBC\u2019s research explores critical areas of sustainability within a building context.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Published in 2019, the CAGBC\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/news-resources\/research-and-reports\/making-the-case-for-zero-carbon-building\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Making the Case for Building to Zero Carbon<\/a> report confirmed that zero carbon buildings are both technically feasible and financially viable. On average, zero carbon buildings can provide a positive financial return over a 25-year life cycle when considering national carbon pollution pricing and require only a modest capital cost premium. Zero carbon buildings\u2019 financial returns will only grow as the cost of carbon rises, while also helping to mitigate future costs for utilities and retrofits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, CAGBC released the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/news-resources\/research-and-reports\/decarbonizing-canadas-large-buildings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Decarbonizing Canada\u2019s Large Buildings<\/a> report, which studied the costs of deep carbon retrofits for 1970s and 1990s vintage buildings and identified key market barriers and solutions. The archetypes within the study were able to reduce fossil fuel consumption by at least 93 percent, while slashing energy by more than 70 percent. Many of the archetypes also yielded a positive financial return on a deep carbon retrofit using a 40-year life cycle, with the remainder becoming cost viable as carbon and energy prices increase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/our-work\/research\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Explore CAGBC\u2019s research<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<\/div><\/details><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-genesis-blocks-gb-accordion gb-block-accordion\"><details><summary class=\"gb-accordion-title\">What is the certification process?<\/summary><div class=\"gb-accordion-text\">\n<p>Pursuing ZCB is simple.
