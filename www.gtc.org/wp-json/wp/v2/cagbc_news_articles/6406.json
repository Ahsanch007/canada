Organized by CAGBC\u2019s advocacy team, the roundtable discussions provided an opportunity for policy-makers and the building sector to explore how to work together to further the ambitious Green Buildings Strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/newsmanager.commpartners.com\/linktrack.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rncanengagenrcan.ca%2Fen%2Fcollections%2Fcanada-green-buildings-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The federal Green Buildings Strategy<\/a> supports Canada\u2019s legislated commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050. To meet such an ambitious target, it is essential that Canada\u2019s buildings are decarbonized. The Strategy will detail federal actions that will be implemented in collaboration with all levels of government, the private sector, communities, and individuals across Canada.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ultimate goal of the Strategy is to chart a path for how the building sector will achieve net-zero emissions and become climate-resilient by 2050, with a projected reduction of associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 37 percent compared to the 2005 levels by 2030. This will require new buildings to be built to zero-carbon standards, accelerating deep carbon retrofits, and ensuring a trained workforce with low-carbon skills. It will also impact the supply chain, which must provide innovative products designed to increase buildings\u2019 energy efficiency and support the electrification of space and water heating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns alignwide is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:50%\">\n<p>CAGBC has supported the development of the Strategy, and through its Zero Carbon Building program and standards, provided the building sector with a way forward. <a href=\"http:\/\/newsmanager.commpartners.com\/linktrack.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cagbc.org%2Four-work%2Fadvocacy%2Fgovernment-submissions%2Fcagbcs-submission-for-the-pre-budget-consultations-in-advance-of-the-2023-budget%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Our most recent recommendations<\/a> as part of the pre-budget consultations reflect the priorities of the Strategy, calling for investment in capacity building for transition plans, a data strategy that includes benchmarking and labelling for ICI buildings, and support for small and medium enterprises that seek Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) and Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) for their low-carbon products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the Green Building Week on the Hill, CAGBC met with various policymakers, from across party lines and various departments. The meetings included Science and Industry Minster Francois-Philippe Champagne, Ambassador for Climate Change Catherine Stewart, and representatives from the Deputy Prime Minister\u2019s Office and the Privy Council Office.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:50%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/dayonthehill2022.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6407\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/dayonthehill2022.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/dayonthehill2022-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This advocacy week culminated with a reception on Parliament Hill, made possible thanks to the Members who sponsored this event:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Julie Dabrusin<\/strong>, Member of Parliament for Toronto\u2013Danforth and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources and to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>G\u00e9rard Deltell<\/strong>, Member of Parliament for Louis-Saint-Laurent and Shadow Minister for Environment and Climate Change<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mario Simard<\/strong>, Member of Parliament for Jonqui\u00e8re and Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Critic for Intergovernmental Affairs, Natural Resources and Energy<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Charlie Angus<\/strong>, Member of Parliament for Timmins\u2013James Bay, NDP Critic for Natural Resources (Jobs and Just Transition)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mike Morrice<\/strong>, Member of Parliament for Kitchener Center, Green Party of Canada<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>CAGBC would like also to thank the President of the Treasury Board, Mona Fortier, MP Eric Melillo, as well as representatives from the NDP who took time to speak with CAGBC members at the reception.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We thank all CAGBC board members, members and for their time, energy, and attention during these important meetings.
