CAGBC is now accepting applications for both technical and green building program advisory volunteer roles in a newly reorganized committee structure. CAGBC seeks sustainability professionals and technical experts with experience in the design, construction, and operations of buildings. Members representing these groups are encouraged to apply: building owners (commercial and non-commercial), building design professionals, sustainability consultants, construction specialists, and building operators.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following committees are accepting applications for volunteers. Application information and deadlines are noted further below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cagbc-leed-advisory-committee-nbsp\"><strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-tree-green-color\">CAGBC LEED Advisory Committee:&nbsp;<\/mark><\/strong><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>This new, senior committee is responsible for identifying Canadian market needs for the LEED program and advising on opportunities for alignment across CAGBC\u2019s green building programs. This standing committee meets every second Tuesday from 11:30am to 12:30pm Eastern time, with approximately 30 minutes of pre-reading needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-technical-advisory-groups-tags\"><strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-tree-green-color\">Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs):<\/mark><\/strong><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>These standing committees perform a crucial role in ensuring that the development and administration of CAGBC programs are grounded in technical and scientific considerations of the highest quality. TAG members should have relevant technical knowledge and strong familiarity with CAGBC\u2019s Zero Carbon Building program and\/or LEED. There will be two TAGs:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CAGBC Energy &amp; Engineering TAG (E&amp;E TAG):<\/strong> Since 2007, CAGBC\u2019s E&amp;E TAG has provided critical insight into design and operations aspects of energy performance, HVAC design, electrification energy storage, grid interactions, thermal comfort, controls, and commissioning. The E&amp;E TAG is also looking for on-call specialists in district energy systems, airtightness, refrigerant management, and envelope commissioning. The E&amp;E TAG meets every second Thursday from 4-6pm Eastern time, with 1 hour of pre-reading expected.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CAGBC Embodied Carbon TAG (EC TAG):<\/strong> This new TAG is being formed to advise CAGBC on technical issues related to embodied carbon and whole building life cycle assessment. It will support the CAGBC\u2019s Zero Carbon Building and LEED programs, and foster alignment between the growing number of programs and tools developed by organizations and jurisdictions across the country. The EC TAG will meet for one hour every four weeks, with approximately 30 minutes of pre-reading expected.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-accelerator-groups\"><strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-tree-green-color\">Accelerator Groups:<\/mark><\/strong><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Accelerator groups bring together members who support CAGBC\u2019s vision and want to tackle specific issues and opportunities. They exist for the length of time needed to deliver the targeted goal (often approximately a year). These groups will provide the insights needed to drive positive change in Canada\u2019s built environment through discussion and collaboration. The following new Accelerators are being formed:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Zero Carbon Transition Planning Accelerator: <\/strong>New initiative will identify and address industry needs in support of decarbonizing existing building stock. Key outcomes are expected to include guidance and education for undertaking portfolio and asset-level zero-carbon transition plans. This Accelerator will also foster alignment between programs and tools developed by organizations and jurisdictions across the country. Meetings are expected to take place at least monthly, with some preparation required.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>LEED v5 Accelerators (BD+C and O+M)<\/strong>: Feedback from CAGBC membership will be critical to ensuring the Canadian market\u2019s needs are represented in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/news-resources\/cagbc-news\/the-lead-up-to-leed-v5\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">development of LEED v5<\/a>. Participants are expected to bring experience with LEED (LEED APs with Specialities preferred). Two groups are currently anticipated: one for Building Design and Construction (BD+C) and one for Operations and Maintenance (O+M). Meetings will be focused on specific subject areas, so participants would only be expected to attend areas of interest. Meetings will be established as needed, guided by the release of new LEED v5 drafts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to apply<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>The deadline for applications is <strong>Monday, October 16, at noon ET<\/strong>. Interested parties should submit their application by email <a href=\"mailto:%20info@greentradecouncil.com?subject=Application%20for%20[Committee%20Name]\"><u>here<\/u><\/a> and indicate \u201cApplication for [Committee Name]\u201d in the subject line. Please include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>a cover email articulating your area of interest and specifying the committee of interest and how your skill set matches those outlined above;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>curriculum vitae (or link to LinkedIn profile or another relevant site);<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>current LEED credentials, if any; and,<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>if appropriate, a list of relevant project experience and the role you played on these projects.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants will be informed of application status by late November. Some committees will form immediately, while others will launch in early 2024.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Accelerators are open to all <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/get-involved\/become-a-member\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CAGBC corporate members<\/a> (Catalyst, Specialist, and Advocate member levels) while the CAGBC LEED Advisory Committee and Technical Advisory Groups are open to Catalyst and Specialist member levels. All committee members will be required to agree to a Code of Conduct, Conflict of Interest, and Confidentiality policy. Note that for the CAGBC LEED Advisory Committee and Technical Advisory Groups to remain unbiased, representatives from product manufacturers and trade associations cannot be appointed to these groups; however, the Accelerators are open to all members.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Appointments to these committees will aim to achieve a diversity of relevant experience, professional perspectives, market and geographical representation, and gender balance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only one individual per member company may be represented on each committee, except for the Accelerators where two per firm are allowed due to the larger capacity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The committees operate in English.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you interested in making a valuable contribution to the growth of
