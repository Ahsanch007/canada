We will continue to promote zero-carbon buildings and deep carbon retrofits to match the global necessity to eliminate operational emissions and reduce embodied carbon by 40 percent by 2030.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other conversations at COP28 which will have an impact on the Canadian building sector include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Whole-life carbon<\/strong> which describes the combined total of embodied and operational emissions over the whole life cycle of a building is growing in significance. All carbon emissions from buildings need to be accounted for and reduced for the sector to reach its climate change targets.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Nature-based solutions<\/strong>, driven by the new Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures, will require industry to limit impacts on ecosystems from development and to find ways to restore natural systems to protect biodiversity, promote carbon sequestration and increase resilience.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>At the end of COP, 198 countries called on <strong>transitioning away from fossil fuels<\/strong> for energy systems, and the adoption of clean energy by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cop28.com\/en\/global-renewables-and-energy-efficiency-pledge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tripling renewable energy capacity<\/a> and doubling the energy efficiency rate by 2030.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Carbon disclosure and regulations<\/strong>: In side-events, we saw the prominent role of the International Sustainability Standards Board. Financial institutions are increasingly considering carbon as a value and are moving toward credible carbon accounting practices. For the real estate sector, this means that asset managers need to track carbon emissions alongside water, energy, and waste.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Adaptation and resilience<\/strong>: companies are being pushed by the finance sector such as banks, insurance companies and investors to demonstrate that their buildings consider climate risks and opportunities in alignment with ESG requirements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-advocating-for-the-green-building-sector\">Advocating for the green building sector<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>CAGBC had also the opportunities to connect with Minister Champagne and Ambassador Stewart to discuss the importance of zero carbon buildings, low-carbon cement and concrete, and the important role industry will play in advancing these innovations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These discussions and the Breakthrough Agendas validate CAGBC\u2019s strategy to focus on transition planning at the building and portfolio level. Following COP, CAGBC will continue to advocate for a <a href=\"https:\/\/natural-resources.canada.ca\/sites\/nrcan\/files\/public-consultation\/cgbs-discussion-paper-2023-08-03-eng.pdf\">Green Buildings Strategy<\/a> in Canada which is aligned with the international Buildings Breakthrough commitments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To maintain momentum, we are looking forward to the first-ever\u202f<a href=\"https:\/\/www.unep.org\/events\/conference\/buildings-and-climate-global-forum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Buildings and Climate Global Forum<\/a>, to be held on 7-8 March 2024 in Paris, France. This forum will bring together ministers from around the world, as well as stakeholders across the building sector value chain, including local authorities, NGOs, and businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-looking-ahead\">Looking ahead<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The toughest parts of the negotiations were clearly the phasing down\/phasing out fossil fuels and the financing climate actions, particularly support for adaptation and resilience. With the mention of transitioning from fossil fuel (a first in 30 years of climate diplomacy), a step was taken to limit global warming. Unfortunately, the financial support on adaptation is postponed to next year\u2019s discussions in Azerbaijan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the spectre of climate change and its impact on the planet and people remains dire, I left COP28 feeling more optimistic that progress is being made. While change is not happening at the scale and speed required to bend the emission curve downward, we did see many examples of practical, proven solutions being rolled out globally, clearly demonstrating a market shift towards low-carbon business practices. These solutions reflect a deep understanding that the path forward will require a holistic approach requiring the collaboration of government and business \u2013 the latter represented in significant numbers for the first time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Recently, I had the opportunity to travel to Dubai in the United Arab&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":""},"cagbc_tx_theme":[422],"cagbc_tx_rating_standard":[],"cagbc_tx_credit_category":[],"acf":{"sub-headline":"","byline":"Thomas Mueller","downloads":false,"related_links":false,"alt_thumb":false,"rating_systemstandard":false,"theme":[{"term_id":422,"name":"Advocacy","slug":"advocacy","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":422,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_theme","description":"","parent":0,"count":70,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"credit_category":false},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.9 (Yoast SEO v21.9) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>COP28: What does it mean for Canada\u2019s building sector? - Green Trading Council (GTC)<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Recently, I had the opportunity to travel to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates to participate as an observer in the UN Climate Change Conference.
