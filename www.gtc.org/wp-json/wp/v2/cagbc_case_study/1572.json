UTSC is known for leading scholarship in the environment\u2014addressing the social and ecological dimensions of natural resources and the environment to improve sustainability. That&#8217;s why at UTSC, being green means being connected\u2014to the local farmers who supply our food outlets, through our academic endeavours, and by our responsibility to future generations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are committed to building a sustainable community through outreach and education on important issues like climate change, resource valuation, and conservation. We&#8217;re planning responsibly, preserving resources and reducing our environmental impact. Faculty, staff, and students are reducing our environmental footprint by conserving energy, promoting renewable energy, alternative transportation and recycling.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The value of certification for athletes, students and the community<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This certification demonstrates the social responsibility taken on by the owners and by the federal government, as well as the global audience that will be attending the games. Building facilities with sustainable features ensures environmentally-responsible and efficient buildings that will last for years. UTSC has enthusiastically incorporated energy conservation strategies in the operation, renovation and construction of its facilities, which legitimizes is efforts and provides direction for future campus growth. These principles have been incorporated into academic expansion projects, and will be further established with additional design innovations, such as earth tubes at the campus&#8217; Environmental Science and Chemistry Building (ESCB).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 34%\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-default-font-size\">UTSC is making significant progress by altering how it designs, builds, operates and maintains its facilities to ensure efficient use of natural resources. These projects help the campus conserve energy, reduce the use of raw materials and save money. Over time, more members of the U of T community will live, work and learn in increasingly efficient buildings while enjoying a higher standard of indoor environmental quality.<\/p>\n<\/div><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"282\" height=\"184\" src=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/PCL-Toronto-Pan-Am-Aqautics-Centre-Interior-resized.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2190 size-full\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Performance standards\/goals<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Because swimming pools of this nature generally have significant utility consumption rates, we were particularly interested in targeting optimized energy performance, which was achieved through use of:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Geothermal energy through a ground source heat pump (GSHP) field located under the north parking lot of the facility, comprised of 100 geothermal boreholes, extending 600 feet deep each.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Building envelope materials that combat high humidity and contribute to overall building envelope and energy performance.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Unique air handling units that prevent condensation and reduce the energy demand required to heat the pools.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Through a comprehensive waste management plan, PCL ensured that 95% of construction site waste from the project was diverted from landfill.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Energy and water savings<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The facility has been designed and built to optimize energy performance, achieving a 40% reduction in design energy cost over the Model National Energy Code for Buildings (MNECB) reference building.
