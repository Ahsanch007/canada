TD Bank became an anchor tenant in September 2016, and in January 2018, the building became the home of General Motors Canada\u2019s new Canadian Technical Centre that focuses on self-driving vehicle research and development.<br><br>Ms. Monsod noted that CPMI\u2019s relationships with TD and GM \u2013 both of which have major sustainability programs \u2013 were instrumental in the building\u2019s achievement of LEED Gold, with the two companies supporting certification and helping the property management firm in the process.<br><br>The 101 McNabb project team was able to leverage several tenant-led initiatives as part of its submission, including the addition of 66 electric vehicle charging stations by GM, and TD\u2019s expansive central garbage, recycling and organics program. As well, both tenants provide separate shuttle buses to transport employees to and from public transportation stations and other offices, helping to minimize single-car travel.<br><br>By working through LEED certification, CPMI also established processes with all of its service providers to verify that their practices align with its commitment to sustainability. This included asking services providers to share more information about the products and equipment they use, and determining standards and expectations for lighting purchases, waste or indoor air quality (IAQ) audits, each of which lead to better building performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well, CPMI developed an ongoing commissioning plan as part of the LEED certification process to provide the property management and operations team with a framework for continuing to monitor energy performance and uncover new opportunities to improve.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull is-light\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim\"><\/span><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2400\" height=\"627\" class=\"wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-2484\" alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/101_mcnabb_photos_2400.jpg\" data-object-fit=\"cover\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/101_mcnabb_photos_2400.jpg 2400w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/101_mcnabb_photos_2400-300x78.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/101_mcnabb_photos_2400-1024x268.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/101_mcnabb_photos_2400-768x201.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/101_mcnabb_photos_2400-1536x401.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/101_mcnabb_photos_2400-2048x535.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px\" \/><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-large-font-size\"><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignfull is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a-45-per-cent-reduction-in-energy-use\">A 45 per cent reduction in energy use<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A key factor in 101 McNabb\u2019s successful certification was the building\u2019s strong energy performance and CPMI\u2019s commitment to energy efficiency optimization. The building has an impressive energy use intensity (EUI) of 23.7 eKWh per square foot, contributing to an ENERGY STAR score of 86. Ms. Monsod added that, since 2014, the building\u2019s EUI has decreased by 45 per cent, largely due to the implementation of dramatic upgrades to building systems and scheduling. The property\u2019s tenants played a significant role in this area as well, by working with CPMI to integrate occupancy and daylight control strategies and low-power equipment into their office space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The high performance of the building provided an excellent starting point for further energy efficiency improvements, said Ms. Monsod. In January 2018, CPMI conducted an ASHRAE Level II Energy Audit to support LEED certification. Several operational adjustments were made as a result of the audit\u2019s recommendations, including the optimization of operating hours for the air handling units and upgrades to cooling plant controls.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"integrating-sustainability-into-policies-and-practices\">Integrating sustainability into policies and practices<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to implementing energy-saving measures at 101 McNabb, CPMI also updated its operational policies and practices to ensure ongoing sustainability at the property and in the company\u2019s broader portfolio. As part of its preventative maintenance strategy, CPMI incorporated an indoor air quality (IAQ) management program, including assessments that are aligned with the Indoor Air Quality Building Education and Assessment Model (I-BEAM). All cleaning equipment and products identified in CPMI International\u2019s Green Cleaning Policy now satisfy LEED requirements, and the company has established an Integrated Pest Management Policy.<br><br>As well, 101 McNabb includes other sustainable features such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The use of off-site renewable energy credits (RECs) to offset 100 per cent of energy use<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Low-flow water fixtures that have helped to reduce water use by more than 37 per cent<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Outdoor air ventilation that meets ASHRAE 62.1-2007 requirements<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Replacement of fluorescent exterior lights with LEDs in November 2017, resulting in lower energy consumption and zero mercury content for bulbs<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Intermittent operation of heating boiler pumps<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Installation of filters with a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 and entryway mats to mitigate IAQ contaminants<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ms. Monsod noted that tenant spaces in the building also received recent upgrades, improving occupant comfort and well-being. As part of their office fitouts, tenants were able to take full advantage of the outdoor views offered throughout approximately 56 per cent of the regularly occupied floor space. The property also promotes wellness through several options for physical activity, with a gym onsite and outdoor recreational amenities.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a-commitment-to-environmentally-responsible-property-management\">A commitment to environmentally responsible property management<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For CPMI, LEED certification is a validation of its efforts to make 101 McNabb an excellent facility for customers, as well as an exceptional building from an environmental performance perspective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal, said Ms. Monsod, is to demonstrate a serious commitment to responsible property management through the continuous improvement of sustainability and energy performance throughout its building portfolio.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"214\" height=\"214\" src=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/LEED_Certified_Certified_Web.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/LEED_Certified_Certified_Web.png 214w, https:\/\/www.cagbc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/LEED_Certified_Certified_Web-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center has-tree-green-color has-text-color has-h-8-font-size wp-block-heading\" id=\"leed-score-card\">LEED SCORE CARD<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Certification Level<\/strong>:<strong> <\/strong>Gold<br><strong>Rating System<\/strong>: LEED v4 O+M: Existing Buildings<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With its achievement of a Gold certification under the LEED v4 Building Operations&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2483,"template":"","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":""},"cagbc_tx_rating_standard":[430,34],"cagbc_tx_system_version":[46],"cagbc_tx_building_type":[62],"cagbc_tx_certification_level":[52],"acf":{"street_address":"","city":"Markham","province":"Ontario","downloads":false,"related_links":false,"rating_systemstandard":[{"term_id":430,"name":"LEED","slug":"leed","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":430,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_rating_standard","description":"","parent":0,"count":111,"filter":"raw","meta":[]},{"term_id":34,"name":"LEED v4","slug":"leed-v4","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":34,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_rating_standard","description":"","parent":0,"count":99,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"system_version":[{"term_id":46,"name":"O+M","slug":"leed-om","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_system_version","description":"","parent":0,"count":14,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"certification_level":[{"term_id":52,"name":"Gold","slug":"gold","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":52,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_certification_level","description":"","parent":0,"count":27,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"building_type":[{"term_id":62,"name":"Office","slug":"office","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":62,"taxonomy":"cagbc_tx_building_type","description":"","parent":0,"count":37,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"alt_thumb":false},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.9 (Yoast SEO v21.9) -
